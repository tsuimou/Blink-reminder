# Blink Reminder

A calm macOS background utility that briefly shows two eyes in the notch. The eyes appear every 10–15 minutes, perform a slow blink routine, then disappear. The animation itself is the instruction—no text, no sound, no notifications.

## Why I made this
I wanted a minimal, Apple‑level gentle reminder to rest my eyes without interruptions or noise. The notch overlay provides a subtle, ambient cue that blends into the system.

## Behavior
- Runs in the background
- Most of the time nothing is visible
- At a randomized interval (10–15 minutes), a transparent notch overlay appears
- Two simple eyes appear, blink slowly, then the overlay retracts

## Design Rules
- Eyes only (no mouth/pupils)
- Soft, organic motion
- Slight asymmetry
- No camera, analytics, or notifications
